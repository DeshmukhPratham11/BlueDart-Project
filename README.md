CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins, SonarQube, OWASP, Nexus, Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform 🚀

Overview ✨
This project demonstrates a robust CI/CD pipeline integrating industry-standard tools to automate the entire application lifecycle from development to deployment. The pipeline ensures that code is continuously integrated, tested, and deployed with a focus on automation, security, scalability, and efficiency. It’s all about Automate, Innovate, Celebrate! 🚀

Key Components:

Visual Studio Code ⚙️
The Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for writing and managing code.

GitHub 🔧
Hosts the source code and integrates with Jenkins for Continuous Integration.

Jenkins 🧰
The orchestrator that pulls the latest code from GitHub and triggers the pipeline, ensuring automation.

SonarQube ⚛️
Performs static code analysis to ensure high code quality, detecting bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells.

OWASP Dependency Check ✨
Analyzes project dependencies for security vulnerabilities, ensuring the application is secure.

Nexus Repository 🌐
Stores built artifacts and manages dependencies. Acts as a private repository for Docker images and other binaries.

Docker 🚢
Builds and containerizes the application, making it portable for deployment.

Kubernetes 🛶
Deploys containerized applications, ensuring scalability, resilience, and efficient resource management.

Terraform 🌱
Automates the provisioning of infrastructure. Ensures that environments (e.g., Kubernetes clusters, networking) are consistently and reliably created across different environments.

Pipeline Flow 🌍

Code Development
Developers write code in Visual Studio Code and push changes to GitHub.

Continuous Integration
Jenkins pulls the latest code from GitHub, triggering the pipeline and automating the build and test processes.

Code Quality & Security Checks

SonarQube performs static code analysis to ensure the code meets quality standards.
OWASP scans project dependencies to identify security vulnerabilities.
Infrastructure Provisioning with Terraform

Terraform is used to provision and configure infrastructure for the application, including Kubernetes clusters and networking configurations.
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) ensures that environments are consistently and reproducibly created.
Artifact Management
Built artifacts (e.g., JAR files, Docker images) are stored in Nexus Repository for easy access.

Containerization
Docker builds the application image and pushes it to DockerHub for deployment.

Deployment
Kubernetes pulls the Docker image from DockerHub and deploys it to the cluster, ensuring that the application is scalable, highly available, and resilient.

Pipeline Architecture 🎨
(Include your updated architecture diagram here with Terraform added to the flow for infrastructure provisioning.)

Prerequisites ⚡️
