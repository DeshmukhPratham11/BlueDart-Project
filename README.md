CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins, SonarQube, OWASP, Nexus, Docker, and Kubernetes 🚀

Overview ✨

This project demonstrates a CI/CD pipeline integrating various tools to ensure a streamlined process for application development, testing, and deployment. Below is the breakdown of the tools and their roles:

Key Components:

Visual Studio Code ⚙️

Used as the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for writing and managing code.

Source code is pushed to GitHub.

GitHub 🔧

Serves as the Version Control System (VCS) to host the source code.

Integrates seamlessly with Jenkins for Continuous Integration.

Jenkins 🧰

Orchestrates the pipeline.

Pulls the latest code from GitHub and triggers build processes.

SonarQube ⚛️

Performs static code analysis to detect bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells.

Ensures code quality standards are met.

OWASP Dependency Check ✨

Conducts security analysis to identify vulnerabilities in project dependencies.

Ensures the application meets security standards.

Nexus Repository 🌐

Used to store built artifacts and manage dependencies.

Acts as a private repository for Docker images and other binaries.

Docker 🚢

Builds and containerizes the application.

Images are pushed to DockerHub for deployment.

Kubernetes 🛶

Deploys containerized applications to the cluster.

Ensures scalability, resilience, and efficient resource management.

Pipeline Flow 🌍

Code Development

Developers write code in Visual Studio Code and push changes to GitHub.

Continuous Integration

Jenkins pulls the code from GitHub and triggers the pipeline.

Code Quality & Security Checks

SonarQube performs a code quality analysis.

OWASP checks for dependency vulnerabilities.

Artifact Management

Built artifacts are stored in Nexus Repository.

Containerization

Docker creates an image of the application and pushes it to DockerHub.

Deployment

Kubernetes pulls the Docker image and deploys it in the cluster for production or staging.

Pipeline Architecture 🎨

Below is the architecture diagram for the pipeline:



Prerequisites ⚡️

Jenkins installed and configured with necessary plugins.

SonarQube and OWASP Dependency Check servers set up.
